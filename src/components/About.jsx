    <h1> About </h1>
        <p> I have so many things to wear and every time I get dressed my room is a mess. Sometimes i end up wearing the same things even though I have so many other things to choose from.
            So I created this website to be able to give all my clothes a wear.

            It is to prevent  you from buying another black dress. Cause we know you already have 5 in your closet. Do you really need a 6th black dress?
            This Web application will be a handy tool for organizing your wears and planning your outfit out for the day.
